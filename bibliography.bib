	abstract = {Background
The rising prevalence of obesity and the social pressure for thinness increase the prevalence of dieting. However, little is known about the overall perception of dieting strategies actually used by the general population.
Objectives
Our main objective was to investigate perceptions of weight-loss practices in an observational study in order to identify the most favourable strategy.
Design
Adults from the ongoing Nutrinet-Santé cohort study who had reported engaging in dieting in the three previous years were included in the study. For each diet, detailed information was collected on types of diets, circumstances and perception of the diet, and outcomes. Perceptions were compared across diets using sex-specific mixed effects models.
Result
Among the 48 435 subjects who had completed the respective questionnaire, 12 673 (26.7\%, 87.8\% of women) had followed at least one weight-loss diet in the previous three years. Diet plans prescribed by health professionals and diets conforming to official dietary recommendations were the most favourably perceived among all assessed weight-loss strategies. Alternatively, commercial diet plans and self-imposed dietary restrictions were more negatively perceived (Odds ratios ({OR}) for adherence difficulty 1.30 (95\% confidence interval (0.99;1.7)) in men and {OR} 1.92 (1.76;2.10) in women compared to official nutritional guidelines; {OR} 1.06 (0.82;1.38) in men and {OR} 1.39 (1.26;1.54) in women respectively) compared to official nutritional guidelines.
Conclusion
Official dietary recommendations could be useful tools for maintaining a dietary balance while following a weight-loss diet.},

	abstract = {Objective Recent preliminary studies indicated a seasonal association of {BMI} at admission to inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa ({AN}), indicating lower {BMI} in the cold season for restrictive {AN}. An impaired thermoregulation was proposed as the causal factor, based on findings in animal models of {AN}. However, findings regarding seasonality of {BMI} and physical activity levels in the general population indicate lower {BMI} and higher physical activity in summer than in winter. Therefore, we aimed to thoroughly replicate the findings regarding seasonality of {BMI} at admission in patients with {AN} in this study. Method {AN} subtype, age- and gender-standardized {BMI} scores ({BMI}-{SDS}) at admission, mean daily sunshine duration and ambient temperature at the residency of 304 adolescent inpatients with {AN} of the multi-center German {AN} registry were analyzed. Results A main effect of {DSM}-5 {AN} subtype was found (F(2,298) = 6.630, p = .002), indicating differences in {BMI}-{SDS} at admission between restrictive, binge/purge and subclinical {AN}. No main effect of season on {BMI}-{SDS} at admission was found (F(1,298) = 4.723, p = .025), but an interaction effect of {DSM}-5 subtype and season was obtained (F(2,298) = 6.625, p = .001). Post-hoc group analyses revealed a lower {BMI}-{SDS} in the warm season for restrictive {AN} with a non-significant small effect size (t(203.16) = 2.140, p = .033; Hedges′g = 0.28). Small correlations of mean ambient temperature (r = −.16) and daily sunshine duration (r = −.22) with {BMI}-{SDS} in restrictive {AN} were found. However, the data were widely scattered. Conclusions Our findings are contrary to previous studies and question the thermoregulatory hypothesis, indicating that seasonality in {AN} is more complex and might be subject to other biological or psychological factors, for example physical activity or body dissatisfaction. Our results indicate only a small clinical relevance of seasonal associations of {BMI}-{SDS} merely at admission. Longitudinal studies investigating within-subject seasonal changes might be more promising to assess seasonality in {AN} and of higher clinical relevance.},
